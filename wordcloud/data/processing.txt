Sorry for posting this immediately after the last food aggression post. I think it may be helpful in that situation, so I’d like to post it immediately. I’ll make a photo post tonight to make up for it!

Because I have had food aggressive dogs in the past, one of my top priorities with Maulkin was preventing this from ever becoming an issues. I’ve read a lot of top dog trainers say you should always remove your dog from the food, and never take food from your dog. I think this is good advice for an older dog especially if you don’t know them well, but it can be dangerous with puppies. Dog law states that any dog that can take or defend an object owns that object.* Humans are not dogs. We don’t follow dog law. If my dog wants to eat a chocolate bar, it doesn’t matter that he’s twice as strong as me or a million times better at fighting; he had best give me that chocolate bar the second I reach for it. This is why we play “leave it” and “drop it” with our dogs. We take their toys away, reward them with food, and then give their toys back. Dogs learn that humans don’t operate by dog law, so they don’t mind if we take things from them. Just like toy guarding, food guarding is instinctual with dogs. It’s up to us to teach our dogs that it’s a good thing when we touch their food, especially if it looks like we’re taking it away.

When we first brought Maulkin home, I started out pretty aggressively. He didn’t know “leave it” or “drop it” yet, but he also was naturally submissive and couldn’t hurt me if he tried to bite. I started out by petting him while he ate. He responded by tensing up and eating faster. I then reached into his dish and gave him a treat. I taught him that I’m going to reward him for letting me make him uncomfortable.

Over the next few days, I gradually made the contact more unpleasant. I’d pick up his paws, flip his ears, touch his belly, and each time he’d get a big treat. After a few days, he learned that being touched meant my hand was full of treats. He still tensed a bit when I touched him, but he never became stressed enough to stop eating, his stress response became less pronounced, and he relaxed sooner. After about a week or two, I started putting my fist in his dish and pushing his muzzle out of the way. As soon as his muzzle left the dish, I’d open my hand to reveal tons of treats just for him! And while he was eating the treats in my hand, I’d be putting more in his dish. He learned that my hand approaching his dish in any way meant treats were coming. Now as soon as he sees my hand, Maulkin will stop eating to sniff and see what I have.

My next step was to use my empty hand to block Maulkin’s dish as he ate. Because he was already investigating my hand as I brought it down over his dish, this step was very easy. Once Maulkin looked at me to question why he didn’t have treats, I’d click and reward heavily and then let him back to his food.

The final invasive step is pretty obvious: I began taking Maulkin’s food dish while he was eating. He was already at a point where he’d see my hand and back away from his dish, so it wasn’t a problem to take his dish, give him a treat, add treats to the dish, and return it. Now Maulkin has learned that it’s a very good thing for me to take away his dish.

At this time, Maulkin had learned “drop it” and “leave it” pretty well with toys and treats, so I began using them with his food. I’d let him eat a bit, tell him to drop it, and then use his leash and my hand to encourage him to back away. As soon as he moved away from his dish, I’d give him a reward, add treats to his dish, and give him is release command to let him finish eating. After a few days of this, Maulkin is a pro at backing away from his dish on command.

Possibly the most important point is that during all this progression, I never stopped with the previous steps. I still touch Maulkin when he’s eating, put my hands in his dish, take his dish away, and call him away from his food. And he’s still rewarded for all of it. When my partner’s around, I encourage him to do the same, so Maulkin learns that is good whenever anyone bothers him when eating.

This brings me to the “dealing with food aggression” part of the title. I have a big, lovey tom cat, Scuzzy. I love him to death, but he can be kind of a jerk. He likes to take Maulkin’s treats and try to get into his dish while he eats. I obviously never desensitized Maulkin to having the cats touch his food, so dog law still applies to them. Lately, Scuzzy has been especially insistent, and Maulkin has begun growling. I should have been more watchful and prevented Scuzzy from getting so close, but Maulkin has been very good and so far has only growled when Scuzzy has put his face in the dish. I’m hopeful I can fix this before it becomes a real problem. My plan is to allow Scuzzy to approach Maulkin’s dish, and then immediately reward Maulkin and remove the cat.** This should show Maulkin that I’m going to both defend his food and reward him for not defending it himself.

I’ll keep you posted on how it goes! =3

*This is why it’s a bad idea to insist dogs “share” if one monopolizes on toys. It just causes more conflict, because the less able dog needs to be punished for “taking” toys from the more able dog. Life is unfair. Dogs know this, so we should accept it in some cases.

**If you have a dog with food aggression around other dogs, both dogs will need to be on leash for this, and the other dog will need to be introduced from a great distance. Just reward your aggressive dog for showing any signs of tension and remove the other dog.

Candid Canines: Food Aggression

candidcanines:

    I’ve been in denial in regards to Helo’s food “issue” as I’ve been calling it. Yes, I was aware it could “turn into food aggression,” but I think it already is food aggression. He’s been showing these signs since 5-6 months old, maybe even earlier than that. If I go to pat his head while he’s…

This is such a coincidence! Just last night I was thinking about writing an article on how I’m preventing food aggression in Maulkin. When I was a kid, I used to literally go out into the streets and pick up strays, so I’ve never had a well-adjusted dog until now. My worst dog was Sparky, my first border collie mix. He had fear aggression about EVERYTHING: dogs, men, food, toys, and he’d even guard dog poop. I don’t know if I ever fully fixed any of these issues, but he definitely got much better over time, especially about resource guarding.

As for your list, I don’t necessarily agree. Some dogs guard food if they’re on a restricted diet, have a history of deprivation, or are fed irregularly; but many dogs never develop food aggression after leaving those situations. As far as seeing you as a threat instead of a provider, I think you’d have to show a history of taking FOOD away from him for that. Sometimes I take cat toys away from Maulkin, so he’s learned to be leery of relinquishing any toys to me immediately until he knows I’ll return them. Despite being slightly possessive of toys, I can reach my hand in Maulkin’s dish, and he’ll just turn aside or look up at me to see what I want. There’s no history of me taking food and not returning it, so Maulkin never associates me with food going away. As for your third point: Eh, maybe. It depends how you mean by “leader”. To a dog, “leader” is the provider and protector. If you’re not fulfilling Helo’s needs, then there may be a trust issue between you.

I’m going to tell you how I dealt with Sparky’s food aggression, but I think Helo’s issue may be a problem from the way he acts at the dog park. It sounds like he doesn’t see you as a protector, so I’ll address that, too.

Initially, have your dog tethered before feeding him. Don’t put the food within his reach; instead, put the bowl down and untie your dog while keeping hold of the leash and let him approach and eat some of his food. If your dog is very good with “leave it” or “drop it”, give the command and gently lead your dog away from his dish and tether him.* Give him a high value food reward, and let him watch you add more of that reward to his dish. Untie him and give him his release command and let him finish eating. You’ll know it’s time to move to the next step when your dog immediately turns away from his food to get his reward.

Next, you’ll be giving the “leave it” command and rewarding the dog without tethering him. Keep the leash on him in case he becomes reactive or stressed. (This is best to do with someone else the dog trusts in the room to step on the dog’s leash if there’s any reactivity.) Lead your dog to his normal tethering spot and ask him to stay. Reward him as usual, add the treats to his dish, and give him his release command.

Every few days, gradually step a little closer to your dog before giving the “leave it” command. Be extremely watchful for any signs of stress like a tucked tail, tensing of the neck or legs, or sucking in of the stomach. If your dog becomes stressed, back slowly away and try again at the next meal from farther away. Eventually, you should be able to stand next to your dog and ask him to move away, and he should do so gladly.

The next step is kind of a big leap, and I’ve never thought of a way to make the transition easier. Sparky managed it without any problems, but it took us over a year to get to this point. With someone else your dog trusts holding your dog’s leash, stand next to your dog’s hind leg, but don’t touch him. Some dogs may become reactive from the change in position. (I’m assuming you’ll have been approaching him from the front before rewarding him up until now.) If your dog shows any signs of distress, make the change less drastic and try approaching his from his front shoulder and work your way back at a constant distance or don’t approach his rear leg so closely. Every few days, get a bit closer to his hind leg until you can gently lean your leg against his (Just a tap! You don’t want to apply any real pressure.) without him showing signs of distress. Reward him like before for allowing you to approach or touch him. You’ll want to keep working this until you’re able to reach down and pet his rump. Just apply a little bit of pressure each day, so he learns contact is a good thing, and begin bending down a little until you’re able to reach him. Remember that bending over a dog is very threatening to them, so this may take a very long time. If you have a lot of faith in the person holding the leash, you could try crouching near the dog instead of bending over. Crouching is less threatening, but it makes you more vulnerable if your dog becomes distressed and reacts.

Eventually, when your dog is comfortable with you touching his rump for a few seconds, move gradually up to his middle back, shoulders, neck, and then head. Each time you move up, only make an instant of contact and reward heavily. Stay at your new position for as many meals as it takes until your dog seems completely comfortable with you petting him for several seconds.**

Honestly, at this point, I wouldn’t go any further. I was reckless and stupid as a kid, and I worked my way down Sparky’s head, face, and muzzle until I could insert treats directly into his mouth. I then moved on to touching his dish and removing and adding food while he was eating. Most reactive dogs will NEVER get that comfortable, and you can do a lot of damage by pushing them too far. I was also the only one ever able to do more than pat him without getting a growl, and he was still reactive around other dogs, though to a much lesser extent.***

So, that was pretty much my process. It should work with you and Helo, but I’ve only used it with the one dog. Just use overwhelming common sense when dealing with a stressed puppy. I’d also advise against scolding him for growling if the other dogs bother him. Growling is really important, because otherwise you have a dog that will bite without warning. If Helo shows that he’s uncomfortable, it’s your job to step in and stop whatever it is that’s bothering him from going any further.

This brings me to what I think may have caused this. You’ve mentioned that Helo is sometimes bullied at the dog park, and that he progresses from trying to avoid the problem dog to eventually growling and biting at it. As Helo’s leader, it is absolutely your responsibility to step in before it gets this far. I know you’ve said you try, but you need to put in as much effort as possible to be on top of Helo at all times, even if it means keeping him on a long line in the park so you’re always in reach. If Helo shows any signs of distress, you have to step in and deter the other dog by any means necessary, even if that means holding down the offending dog.**** In an ideal world, people would all keep on top of their dogs and keep them from being obnoxious, but we have to do the best with what we’re given. By stepping in before Helo has to defend himself, you’ll be showing him that he can depend on you to always defend him. He’ll learn to have more faith in your ability to control the environment, so he’ll be more relaxed and less reactive.

The rest of Helo’s behaviour just sounds like normal puppy adolescence to me. Border collies are pretty famous for chewing through walls if they get bored, so I’m not too surprised Helo’s tried his teeth at it. (Are all herding dogs MAD!? Probably.) Maybe try giving him a raw bone and a few extra training sessions to keep him occupied. The bone would give him a physical release, a bit of toy but nothing too stimulating, and training will tire him out from all the mental stimulation. Or that’s the theory, anyway. =P

Good luck surviving adolescence and dealing with food nippies! Keep us all posted, and feel free to drop me a note if my explanation is confusing or Helo reacts oddly.

*If your dog doesn’t know these commands, practice them first with toys for food rewards until he knows them and responds immediately. Don’t pull hard or jerk the leash if your dog ignores you; just use firm, consistent pressure and a calming tone to call your dog away from the food. Any sign of aggression from you might set off an aggressive response, especially in a very reactive dog.

**Sparky and Maulkin both eat faster when I touch them, but they don’t show any tension. It’s up to you to decide what behaviours constitute stress in your dog and which are natural parts of his personality.

***I will make a post on this, because Maulkin has started being a bit reactive to my tom cat who’s always trying to take his food.

****I’ve made some… less-than-friends at our normal park for intercepting and restraining bully dogs. I also have a reputation as being unfriendly for picking up Maulkin when we’re charged by overly-friendly dogs that cause Maulkin to lose his mind. (I pick him up to keep from undermining our training (that he has to wait for a release command to approach other dogs JIC), not because he’s in any danger or stressed. But same principle.)

Dog Food

candidcanines:

    doggydayjob:

        Does anyone know of any high quality puppy food with more than 3% fibre? The salmon flavour of Blue Buffalo Wilderness has 6.5% but the other flavours aren’t rated as highly on dogfoodanalysis.com.*

        We visited a new vet today for a pre-neuter exam.** I mentioned Maulkin’s stool becomes soft in the afternoon, but is firm in the morning and evening. The vet thinks Maulkin needs a higher fibre diet, but that we should keep him on the high calorie range of foods we’ve been feeding. (He’s been on Orijen large breed puppy formula, and he’s doing wonderfully except the intermittent soft stool.) I’m wondering if we shouldn’t just add a tablespoon of pumpkin to his breakfast instead of switching brands. The TOTW recall makes me extremely worried, and I like that Orijen and Acana are processed in a private facility here in Canada using only Canadian foods.

        *I’m concerned about feeding primarily fish to a dog bred to eat sheep and chickens. I think it may be too oily for him. I fed the cats the salmon variety of Orijen and their coats got too oily, so now we stick to chicken.

        **I don’t much like our old vet, so our instructor recommended this one. I like him much better already.

    Hmm if I wasn’t feeling so crappy with this cold, I’d drive out to my old workplace and take a look at the dog food bags LOL I recently switched Helo over to the Innova PRIME. It’s Natura’s newest grain free food, and the turkey and chicken formula has 4% fiber (apparently the beef/lamb formula and salmon/herring formula all have 4% fiber). They don’t have a puppy formula in the grain free, unfortunately, so I add supplements. I’m going to be going back to a raw diet soon though, it’s just costly if you buy it pre-made and time consuming if you make it yourself. I’m just not the greatest chef either!

    Orijen is a really wonderful food. I do think you can get similar quality for a lot less (I don’t know how much it is in Canada, but here in the U.S. it’s going for almost $100 a bag), but I really think Orijen and Acana products are outstanding. All of the livestock is free range in Canada, and apparently they have higher standards for pet food and human food in Canada than they do in the United States.

    It really makes me sad to hear about the Diamond recall, because where I used to work, that was one of the biggest selling brands (along with Orijen, Nature’s Variety, Blue Buffalo, Nutro, Wellness, etc.). But many people in this particular area wanted to buy Diamond Naturals for their pit bulls, to bulk them up (kind of makes me sad, these particular people). It appears that the pit bull community has been spreading the word that Diamond is the best for the breed, and when grain-free started getting “popular” they started switching over to Taste of the Wild.

    I’ve never been a fan of Diamond products, which is why I never fed Taste of the Wild. But I recommended it to a lot of people (along with their Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover’s Soul) usually to get the dog’s off of junk foods like Beneful - since those brands are less expensive than Nature’s Variety, Innova, or Orijen. Yet they still have exceptional ingredients, and that’s the whole point. We just want to feed what’s best for our dogs.

    I say if you prefer to keep him on Orijen, being that Orijen is a remarkable food, try the canned pumpkin before switching over to something else. Food recalls are scary, and can happen to just about any food, regardless of how reputable the brand is. You just have to look out for them.

    Really the only brands I would ever consider (personally) are Nature’s Variety (Instinct or Instinct Raw), Innova, Innova PRIME, California Natural Grain-Free, Orijen… Then I would get into Blue Buffalo Wilderness (I just don’t care for the life source bits), Wellness (never been interested in CORE), Canidae Grain-Free, Nutro Grain-Free. Maybe one of these might help? I really think highly of Nature’s Variety (their duck and turkey has 3.5% fiber - that’s the formula I used to feed) and Orijen the most. But I’ve always had some kind of fondness for Innova and California Natural, which is why I was so happy to see they started making it grain-free as well. 

    Fruits and vegetables are a good source of fiber for dogs. Ask your vet about applesauce? Also… brown rice can add fiber, too, but I see you’ve got Maulkin on a grain-free diet as well. I read that it doesn’t take a lot of fiber to make a big difference in a dog’s digestive system, so I’d probably just add some canned pumpkin to his diet or try the applesauce if it were me.

Thank you so much for the suggestions! I’ve been feeding the cats Orijen for almost two years, and they’ve done so wonderfully on it, it was a no-brainer what to give Maulkin when we brought him home. I’m surprised to hear it’s so expensive there! It’s about $70 for a 60lb bag here, and depending on the store, the 11th or 13th bag is free. I’ve talked to several store owners, and they say it’s sometimes hard to get enough Orijen in a shipment, so I wonder if they don’t hike the price for US sales so they can meet their Canadian demand.

I’ve used Blue Buffalo on the cats, and they liked it. But like you, I don’t like the flavour bits, and Orijen is higher (and higher quality!) protein for about the same price. The cats HATED Wellness CORE, and I found the smell quite unappealing (It’s also much more expensive than Orijen. =/), but we haven’t looked at Wellness. Orijen’s large breed puppy food (I haven’t checked the other foods yet) is also 4% fibre, which seems pretty standard looking at the foods you listed. After Maulkin’s last fecal test comes back (Negative, please! I’d like ONE negative fecal test on our record!), I’ll start adding pumpkin or applesauce to his kibble and see if that helps.

Show Quality or Working Quality?

candidcanines:

    doggydayjob:

        candidcanines:

            There are so many different sides to the dog world. There are the “average” dog owners, and the “dog enthusiasts.” There are those who love all dogs despite shape, size, or whether they are purebred or mixed, and those who care only about the standards and the quality of a purebred. Surprisingly,…

        In border collie circles, there’s a lot of animosity between “working” and “show” border collie people. In general, border collie people are very accepting, especially of appearance and temperament.* There seems to be a disconnect recently between working BC breeders and show BC breeders, where show BC breeders have begun breeding for a certain look. (The AKC and CKC handbooks both say drive and physical ability are more important than looks in BCs, and there’s a huge range of acceptable appearances. I’m not really sure what the show breeders are breeding for, but their dogs do look different than farm and sport BCs just in the past decade…) To those of us who like BCs because of their amazing endurance, intelligence, and drive, breeding for looks over physical ability is just weird and potentially very damaging. I’d rather a scruffy looking farm dog than one who can’t hold a BC crouch or run for an hour without stopping!

        Personally, I don’t like purebred dogs very much because they’re usually very inbred and are more likely to have health problems than mutts.** Of course, the nice thing about a purebred dog is that you have a good idea how they’ll turn out, which is good if you’re looking for a certain level of drive or endurance. (Couch potatoes should not get Aussie mixes, for example!)

        Being a die-hard cat person, I’ve never encountered such widespread extremism. You can even show “mixed breed” cats in cat shows. (They’re called domestic mixes, and they’re treated like their own breed.) Of course, there are still crazy people who breed for extreme looks even though it’s damaging to the cats. Designer cats are really becoming more popular recently, I think, and it’s not a good thing…

        *For example, I was looking to see when border collies’ ears usually stand; because I’d like to know if Maulkin’s might stand up or stop flopping around and stay down soon; and someone asked if they should tape their puppy’s ears up to make them stand. Everyone on the forum expressed enjoying all ear types, and many people posted photos of their puppies going through “ear confusion” and others posted photos of their dogs with one ear up and one down. The general consensus was that it’s unnecessary to tape a BC’s ears, because it doesn’t change their behaviour.

        **That is to say, I don’t like people who fixate on having a dog look a certain way, especially if it’s so extreme as to cause health problems for the dog. (Pug and bulldog people, I’m looking at you! >/) I don’t hold it against the dogs themselves, obviously. =P

    That’s really interesting! I remembered reading something along the lines of this when I was looking for local Border Collie breeders in the area (honestly, I have to admit it’s because of Maulkin LOL). Ultimately, I decided to get Helo and perhaps adopt from a Border Collie rescue in the not-so-near future. But I definitely recall some kind of fray between working dog breeders and show dog breeders. That’s why I mentioned herding breeds as an example.

    P.S. I am a bit of a couch potato at times! But I still make time to get the pups out to burn off that energy of theirs! It’s sad. My fiance’s friend from out of state found an Australian Cattle Dog puppy on the side of the road several months ago. Apparently they are getting rid of it because their yard is too small… Sounds like an excuse to me. We have a nice sized yard, and we barely use it. The dogs do most of their exercising on the beach or at the dog park. Getting rid of a dog because you think your yard is too small, is absurd. I think it’s an excuse because they may be tired of the puppy’s behavior. Most likely they haven’t worked on any sort of training or exercise, so you can imagine how that high energy pup must feel?

    Anyway, back to the original topic! I really agree on your opinion regarding the health of the animals. If I were to ever go to a breeder for a dog in the future, I would personally choose one who breeds for temperament and health. Not for physical appearance. But you’re right about the purebreds being inbred and more likely to have health problems.

    I watched a documentary the other day about dog genetics, and it was really an eye opener on the damage we’re doing to the dogs by breeding purebreds. It was really shocking, though, because most people have the idea that if you go to a reputable breeder who breeds for health, you expect to get a puppy that will never have health problems… When really, it’s a hit or miss. Any of those puppies can end up with health problems, and I think the chances are increased the further those purebred lines go.

    I’ve met countless dog owners who had purchased puppies from reputable breeders, only to find out the puppy had a health problem at just a few months old… They turn it around and bad mouth the breeder, who may have really been reputable. Now you just don’t know, because you just can’t guarantee the health of the puppies. The breeders can be recording their dog’s health, and breeding only the healthy ones, but we could actually be making their health issues even worse, and maybe even increasing the chances that the puppies will be effected.

    Sorry, I always get so off track when I start ranting about these things! There is just so much to learn and think about in the dog world. As much as I’d like for people to spay and neuter their dogs to prevent accidental litters, I really do like mixed breeds quite a bit.

Aww, that’s really sweet that you wanted to get a BC because of Maulkin! Despite his looks, he’s really only about half BC. We think he’s BC, GSD, and sheltie/Aussie cattle dog/Canaan dog. (We’re not sure which of the last three, but my money’s on cattle dog. I don’t know where his grandmother would have found a Canaan dog around here to mate, but his mum’s handlers thought she was a BC-Canaan.)

Man, there is nothing more frustrating than lazy dog owners! ARGH! Actually, I wanted to adopt from the only BC shelter (or that I’m aware of) in Ontario, but they have a strict rule that all adopters much have a fully fenced-in yard. As if having a fenced yard will keep my puppy active! He won’t exercise himself if I’m not out there engaging him, so how is a fenced yard better than living near a park and owning a long leash!? When I was looking for border collies from non-breeders (I wanted one from a farm, but there were lots of people who took them on as pets and then found out they’re terrible pets for the average person!), tons of people were selling their very young puppies, but only to people on farms or with large back yards. It’s so ridiculous, because most any dog left to its own devices is going to dig a big hole and lay in the shade napping waiting for it’s handler to come out and engage it. Dogs don’t just run laps on their own for the fun of it.*

Anyway, I believe strongly in striking a balance between your and your dogs’ needs. It’s okay to be a couch potato sometimes so long as your dogs are getting enough stimulation. (Yours obviously are, or they’d have chewed through a wall long ago! Herding dogs are so insistent!) On the other hand, if you’re a mad cycle enthusiast and you ride your bike for five hours a day, you probably shouldn’t get a pug. If you do have a pug, it’s your job to find a way to stimulate and involve your dog in your life without expecting it to run beside your bike for miles and miles. (A BC would love it, but a pug would probably literally die. But if you’re willing to attach a basket to your bike and ride a bit slower, the pug might enjoy the ride!)

Anyway, like you, I’m also torn between encouraging spaying/neutering and loving mutts. I figure there will ALWAYS be border collies and Aussies in the world, because even after sheep rearing is done by machines or in a tube, BCs and Aussies are THE BEST at dog sports. But not everyone is suited to such high drive and energy levels. I worry where the pet industry would go with only breeders around. Most purebred dogs designed for companionship have been driven to unhealthy extremes (Thinking of pugs again. I’m always thinking of pugs. =[), and I can’t imagine that slowing down. On the up-side, Crufts this year implemented basic vet checks by on-site vets before dogs could enter their shows.** That means that breeders who want to win Crufts have to breed dogs with clear airways, decent hips, and healthy skin and eyes! If we keep fighting for moderation from breeders and spay/neuters from everyone else, we might do right by dogs in the long run.

*With the obvious exception of when you have more than one dog. Because, well, chasing your “siblings” is more fun than napping.

**Of course, there was a huge backlash from some breeders, saying people want to destroy their breeds. Um, no, we just want them to be healthy! THEY SHOULD, TOO! It’s their chosen breed!

We took Maulkin to the small dog park (the one on the lake with the climbing rocks) again today, because he’s in desperate need of socializing directly with other dogs.* There were only about five dogs there at the busiest time, and most of them were puppies around Maulkin’s age. He had a great time playing chase with the fluffy white dog (I think he was an American Eskimo dog?), but he was nervous around the 16 week old bulldog puppy!

I’ll make a text post later about the park. It was a great experience for Maulkin, but I sometimes worry about the future of dog handling watching the way some people interact with their dogs…

*He’s great at walking past other dogs on the street or in the park, and he’s good at greeting new dogs and puppies in class, but he’s not very good at communicating with dogs that don’t want to play.

Candid Canines: Parallel Universes in the Dog World

candidcanines:

    There are so many different sides to the dog world. There are the “average” dog owners, and the “dog enthusiasts.” There are those who love all dogs despite shape, size, or whether they are purebred or mixed, and those who care only about the standards and the quality of a purebred. Surprisingly,…

In border collie circles, there’s a lot of animosity between “working” and “show” border collie people. In general, border collie people are very accepting, especially of appearance and temperament.* There seems to be a disconnect recently between working BC breeders and show BC breeders, where show BC breeders have begun breeding for a certain look. (The AKC and CKC handbooks both say drive and physical ability are more important than looks in BCs, and there’s a huge range of acceptable appearances. I’m not really sure what the show breeders are breeding for, but their dogs do look different than farm and sport BCs just in the past decade…) To those of us who like BCs because of their amazing endurance, intelligence, and drive, breeding for looks over physical ability is just weird and potentially very damaging. I’d rather a scruffy looking farm dog than one who can’t hold a BC crouch or run for an hour without stopping!

Personally, I don’t like purebred dogs very much because they’re usually very inbred and are more likely to have health problems than mutts.** Of course, the nice thing about a purebred dog is that you have a good idea how they’ll turn out, which is good if you’re looking for a certain level of drive or endurance. (Couch potatoes should not get Aussie mixes, for example!)

Being a die-hard cat person, I’ve never encountered such widespread extremism. You can even show “mixed breed” cats in cat shows. (They’re called domestic mixes, and they’re treated like their own breed.) Of course, there are still crazy people who breed for extreme looks even though it’s damaging to the cats. Designer cats are really becoming more popular recently, I think, and it’s not a good thing…

*For example, I was looking to see when border collies’ ears usually stand; because I’d like to know if Maulkin’s might stand up or stop flopping around and stay down soon; and someone asked if they should tape their puppy’s ears up to make them stand. Everyone on the forum expressed enjoying all ear types, and many people posted photos of their puppies going through “ear confusion” and others posted photos of their dogs with one ear up and one down. The general consensus was that it’s unnecessary to tape a BC’s ears, because it doesn’t change their behaviour.

**That is to say, I don’t like people who fixate on having a dog look a certain way, especially if it’s so extreme as to cause health problems for the dog. (Pug and bulldog people, I’m looking at you! >/) I don’t hold it against the dogs themselves, obviously. =P

Thunder

We’ve had two thunder storms in the past week (our first storms of the season!), and Maulkin did really, really well. He definitely noticed the thunder, but he was quick to ignore it when I offered him treats or a toy.

I strongly believe the best way to deal with anxiety is to prevent it from developing in the first place. Fear of thunder is such a huge deal with dogs, and it can affect every breed, size, and temperament of dog. For the past few weeks, I’ve had super special treats on stand-by awaiting our first storm. When the first bit of thunder came, every time thunder would strike, I’d say very excitedly “KABOOM!!” and give Maulkin lots of chicken bits. Needless to say, he got pretty excited to hear the thunder and would look at me expectantly for his chicken and freak-out fun party. For the storm we had today, I did the same thing, except I substituted a toy for the chicken. (Maulkin’s toy drive is so high, he’d choose a toy over chicken almost always.) After the first crack of thunder, Maulkin ignored the entire storm so he could focus on fetching.

I’ve had thunder-phobic dogs before, so it’s a huge relief that Maulkin is responding so well. We’ll keep up the storm-partying for the rest of the season to make sure Maulkin doesn’t lose his enthusiasm for thunder as he ages.
